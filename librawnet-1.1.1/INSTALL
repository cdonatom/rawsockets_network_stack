Installation instructions of librawnet library

1. Unpack the source code of the library
   (If you are reading this probably it is already done)

   tar xvzf librawnet-1.1.1.tar.gz

2. Go to the new directory

   cd librawnet-1.1.1/

3. Compile the source code of the library
   (Make clean is an optional step, just in case a previous compilation has
   failed)

   make clean
   make all

4. Install the library, include files and manual pages.
   For this step you need superuser rights. Execute it as root or with sudo

   make install

5. Enjoy !!

6. If you want to uninstall the librawnet library, "make uninstall" as root
   will do the trick.
