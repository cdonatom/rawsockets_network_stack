.SH "NAME"
rawnet_poll() - Function to listen multiple "raw" interfaces.
.PP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
.B #include <rawnet.h>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function listens packets in multiple interfaces simultaneously. When any
of the of the specified interfaces receives a packet, the function will return
the first interface that has a packet ready to be received by means of the
\fBrawnet_recv()\fP function.
.PP
This operation is able to listen the interfaces indefinitely or a limited time
depending on the \fItimeout\fP parameter.
.PP
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIifaces\fP is an array with the interfaces' handlers to receive from. All
interfaces must have been previously initialized with \fBrawiface_open()\fP.
.PP
\fIifnum\fP specifies the number of interfaces that the \fIifaces\fP array
contains.
.PP
\fItimeout\fP is the time in milliseconds that should be waited for a packet
to be received before returning. A negative number specifies that the function
should wait indefinitely. 
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The index of the first interface [0, ifnum-1] that has a packet ready to be
received or -2 if the timer has expired.
.PP
.SH "ERRORS"
.PP
Function returns -1 if some error has occur. The full error description can be
obtained by means of the \fBrawnet_strerror()\fP function.
