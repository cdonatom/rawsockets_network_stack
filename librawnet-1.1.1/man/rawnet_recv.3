.SH "NAME"
rawnet_recv() - Function to receive "raw" packets.
.PP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
.B #include <rawnet.h>
.sp
.BI "int rawnet_recv ( rawiface_t * " iface ", unsigned char " buffer "[], int " buf_len ", long int " timeout " );"
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function obtains the next packet received by the specified interface. 
This operation could wait indefinitely or a limited time depending on the
\fItimeout\fP parameter.
.PP
This function is able to receive packets just from a single interface. If you
want to listen to several interfaces simultaneously, use the
\fBrawnet_poll()\fP function.
.PP
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fIiface\fP is the handler of the interface where the packet is received
from. The interface must have been previously initialized with
\fBrawiface_open()\fP. 
.PP
\fIbuffer\fP specifies the array where the content of the received packet will
be stored, including the layer 2 and upper headers.
.PP
\fIbuf_len\fP is the maximum buffer size in bytes . If the size of the buffer
is lower than the one of the received packet, only \fIbuf_len\fP bytes will be
copied into \fIbuffer\fP, although the function will return the total length
of the received packet.
.PP
\fItimeout\fP specifies the time in milliseconds that should be waited for a
packet to be received before retuning. A negative number specifies that the
function should wait indefinitely, while with a 0 the function will return
immediately no matter a packet has been received or not.
.PP
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The length in bytes of the received packet, or 0 if no packet has been
received because the timer has expired.
.PP
Notice that the returned length may be greater than the maximum number of
bytes (\fIbuf_len\fP) copied into \fIbuffer\fP.
.PP
.SH "ERRORS"
.PP
Function returns -1 if some error has occurred. The full error description can
be obtained by means of the \fBrawnet_strerror()\fP function.
