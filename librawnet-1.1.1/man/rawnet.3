.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This library allows accessing directly to the host network interfaces, as well
as sending and receiving "raw " packets, that is, packets that have not been
processed by the network stack of the host.
.PP
This way it is possible to develop a network protocol stack from scratch, that
are able to generate and process all headers of packets.
